# Project Description
This script implements a word guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly selected word from a predefined list of words. The player can guess one letter at a time and receives feedback on their guesses.

# Coding The Project
We will prompt the user to enter a letter until they either guess the word or run out of attempts. The program will reveal correctly guessed letters in their positions and will track the remaining attempts. To achieve this, we will need to use the following concepts:
- **While Loop**: This will serve as the game loop, ensuring that the user is prompted until they either win or lose.
- **Input Statement**: We will receive user input to obtain the player's letter guesses.
- **Random Module**: This module will be used to randomly select a word from the list.
- **List and String Manipulation**: We'll use lists to store the current state of the guessed word and to check against the player's guesses.

Altogether, once all of these concepts are applied correctly, we will have a functioning word guessing game.

# Dependencies
- **random** module (comes with Python, so no installation is required)
