# Project Description
This script allows two players to play Tic Tac Toe on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns entering their moves, and the game checks for a winner or a draw.

# Coding The Project
We will create a simple command-line interface for the game. To achieve this, we will need to use the following concepts:
- **While Loop**: To manage the game flow and alternate turns between players.
- **Input Statement**: To receive player moves and validate their input.
- **List Manipulation**: To represent the game board and check for win conditions.

Altogether, once all of these concepts are applied correctly, we will have a working Tic Tac Toe game.

# Dependencies
- No additional modules are required, as this can be done with basic Python functionalities.
