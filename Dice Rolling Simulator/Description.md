# Project Description
We want the user to choose a number of dice. For each die, a random number between 1 and 6 will be generated.

# Coding The Project
We will prompt the user to enter an integer representing the number of dice until they provide a valid input. The program will then generate a random number for each die. To achieve this, we will need to use the following concepts:
- **For Loop**: A for loop will be used to perform an operation a specified number of times (generating a random number between 1 and 6 for each die).
- **Input Statement**: We will need to receive user input to specify the number of dice.
- **Random Module**: This module will be used to generate random numbers.

Altogether, once all of these concepts are applied correctly, we will have a functioning Dice Rolling Simulator.

# Dependencies
- **random** module (comes with Python, so no installation is required)
