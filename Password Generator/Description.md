# Project Description
This script generates a random password based on user-defined criteria. The user can specify the length of the password and choose whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

# Coding The Project
We will prompt the user to enter the desired password length and preferences for including different types of characters. To achieve this, we will need to use the following concepts:
- **Input Statement**: To gather user preferences for the password.
- **Random Module**: This module will be used to generate random characters based on user preferences.
- **String Manipulation**: To create the final password string by combining different character types.

Altogether, once all of these concepts are applied correctly, we will have a functional password generator.

# Dependencies
- **random** module (comes with Python, so no installation is required)
